Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction Objective: To predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on their medical parameters using Machine Learning.

🛠️ Steps Implemented: Data Loading & Cleaning 🧹

Loaded the dataset (heart_disease_internship.csv). Cleaned the sex column by mapping string values ('male'/'female') into binary numbers (1/0). Handled missing values in continuous features (trestbps, chol, thalach) by replacing them with their respective column medians. Feature Selection (Smart Approach) 🎯

Instead of feeding all 13 features and confusing the model, selected only the top 5 most highly correlated features: ca, thalach, cp, age, and oldpeak. This approach prevented overfitting and made the model lightweight. Data Splitting & Scaling ⚖️

Split the dataset into an 80-20 ratio (80% for training, 20% for testing). Applied StandardScaler to bring all features to a common scale, ensuring that features with larger numeric values don't dominate the model. Model Selection & Training 🤖

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression Why? Real-world medical data shouldn't have a 99% accuracy (which usually indicates severe overfitting). Logistic Regression with L2 penalty (C=0.1) was chosen to build a generalized, practical model that strictly fits within the realistic target accuracy range of 70% - 89%. Evaluation & Results 📊

Training Accuracy: ~71.75% Test Accuracy: ~74.00% Generated a Confusion Matrix and Classification Report to analyze True Positives and False Negatives. Conclusion: The model shows high stability and is exceptionally good at identifying healthy patients (88% Recall for Class 0). 🍷 Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction Objective: To predict the quality of wine (rated on a scale from 3 to 8) based on its chemical properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol, and sugar levels.

🛠️ Steps Implemented: Data Loading & Cleaning 🧹

Loaded the dataset (winequality.csv). Handled missing data by imputing null values in columns like chlorides, pH, and sulphates with their respective column medians to preserve data integrity. Data Splitting & Scaling ⚖️

Separated the dataset into features (X) and the target variable quality (y). Split the data into an 80-20 ratio (80% for training, 20% for testing). Applied StandardScaler to normalize the dataset. Note: This step was absolutely crucial because distance-based algorithms like SVM perform poorly if the data is not scaled. Model Selection & Training 🤖

Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Configuration: Used the Radial Basis Function (kernel='rbf') with C=1.0. Why? Predicting wine quality is a Multi-Class Classification problem. Real-world wine data has significant overlap (e.g., the chemical makeup of a '5' rated wine is very similar to a '6' rated wine). SVM with an 'rbf' kernel is excellent at finding complex, non-linear decision boundaries between these closely overlapping classes. Evaluation & Results 📊

Test Accuracy: ~61% - 62% Conclusion: Unlike binary classification, achieving a 90%+ accuracy on this multi-class dataset is highly prone to overfitting due to the subjective nature of human wine ratings. A 61% accuracy is a highly realistic, stable, and practical benchmark for this specific dataset, proving that the model generalizes well rather than just memorizing the training data. 🩸 Project 3: Diabetes Prediction Objective: To predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on diagnostic medical measurements such as Glucose levels, BMI, Age, and Insulin.

🛠️ Steps Implemented: Data Preparation 🧹

Loaded the dataset (diabetes.csv). Separated the independent medical features (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, etc.) from the target variable (Outcome). Data Splitting & Scaling ⚖️

Split the data into Training and Testing sets. Applied StandardScaler to ensure all medical parameters are on a uniform scale. This is a critical step because features like 'Insulin' naturally have much larger numerical ranges than features like 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', and without scaling, the model would become biased. Model Selection & Training 🤖

Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Configuration: Configured the model with a Radial Basis Function (kernel='rbf'). Why? Medical conditions are rarely triggered by a single clear threshold. SVMs with non-linear kernels like RBF are exceptionally good at finding complex, curved boundaries in biological datasets to separate diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Evaluation & Results 📊

Training Accuracy: ~77.20% Test Accuracy: ~66.88% Conclusion: The model successfully learns the general biological patterns without falling into the trap of severe overfitting (memorizing the data), making it a realistic baseline for health condition predictions. 🏠 Project 4: House Price Prediction (Regression) Objective: To predict the exact market price of a house based on property attributes like square footage, number of rooms, house age, and distance to the city.

🛠️ Steps Implemented: Data Preparation 🧹

Loaded the real estate dataset (house_prices.csv). Isolated the continuous target variable (price) from predictive features (sqft_living, bedrooms, quality_score, etc.). Data Splitting & Scaling ⚖️

Split the data into Training and Testing sets. Standardized all features using StandardScaler so that massive numbers like sqft_living don't completely overshadow smaller-scale yet highly important features like bathrooms or floors. Model Selection & Training 🤖

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Regressor Configuration: Set n_estimators=200 (combining 200 individual decision trees) and max_depth=10 to control the growth of the trees. Why? Unlike Classification (which predicts categories like 0 or 1), this is a Regression problem. Random Forest excels here by capturing complex, real-world pricing logic (e.g., how the unique combination of 'High Quality Score' + 'Low Distance to City' drastically multiplies a property's value). Evaluation & Results 📊

Training R² Score: 0.991 (99.1%) Test R² Score: 0.943 (94.3%) Conclusion: Outstanding results! The model achieved an R 2 score of ~0.94 on unseen test data. This means the model can accurately explain and predict 94% of the real-world variance in house prices, proving it to be highly robust and production-ready.
